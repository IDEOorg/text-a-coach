What is it? What does it do? What can I do with it?

## Background

TODO: Project objectives... How and why it came to be.

## Quick Start

### Local Setup

#### Requirements

To get started, make sure you have the following tools installed and available:

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
- [Bower](https://bower.io/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/) (v5.11)

#### Dependencies

Download vendor dependencies with the following commands:

```
cd /path/to/project
npm install
bower install
```

### Local Server

Each time you want to work on the app, you can run the local web server:
```
gulp serve --env=dev
```

Your app should be available at http://localhost:3000/

### Remote Server

The app is designed to run easily on a Node [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) instance.

You should be able to connect Heroku to your Github repository and do a [deploy](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app).

### Production Files

Alternatively, you can build the production static files with
```
gulp --env=prod
```

The resulting built files will be inside `/dist`. You can upload and serve them from just about any simple webserver.
